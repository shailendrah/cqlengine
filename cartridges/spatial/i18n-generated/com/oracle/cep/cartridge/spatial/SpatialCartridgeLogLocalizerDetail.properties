messagedetail2069000="{0}" is reserved for the server cartridge context.
cause2069000=The reserved server cartridge context name was used for the application cartridge context name.
action2069000=Use other name.
messagedetail2069001="{3}" is already using the same srid.
cause2069001=The same srid is already used either in the same application or from other application.
action2069001=Use other srid.
messagedetail2069002=The 'Contain' operator can only be used with GTYPE_POINT.
cause2069002=Non-point geometry type is used for contain operator.
action2069002=Use point geometry type.
messagedetail2069003=The buffering operation has failed with the exception below.
cause2069003=The cause is unknown.
action2069003=Consult the message from the exception.
messagedetail2069004=The buffering operation has failed because the SRID of the geometry does not match with that of the spatial context.
cause2069004=The SRID of the geometry does not match with that of the spatial context.
action2069004=Make sure the geometry is created with the same SRID from the spatial context in use.
messagedetail2069005=Operations on geometries containing arcs must use non-zero tolerance. This is needed because arcs must be densified.
cause2069005=Zero-tolerance used on geometries containing arcs.
action2069005=Make sure you specify a non-zero tolerance.
messagedetail2069006=Operation "{0}" on geodetic 3D geometries not supported.
cause2069006=Operation "{0}" on geodetic 3D geometries not supported.
action2069006=Change 3D geometry to use cartesian coordinates, or perform a Gnomonic transformation (projection) prior to invoking operation.
messagedetail2069007=Containing geometry must either be a solid 3D geometry, or contained geometry must be a point inside a 3D geometry.
cause2069007=Containing geometry must either be a solid 3D geometry, or contained geometry must be a point inside a 3D geometry.
action2069007=
messagedetail2069008=Operation "{0}" on compound 3D geometries is not supported. Compound geometries are geometries that contain arcs in addition to lines.
cause2069008=Compound 3D geometries are not supported.
action2069008=Use 3D geometries that do not contains arcs.
messagedetail2069009=Unknown geometry type : {0} is used.
cause2069009=Unknown geometry type : {0} is used.
action2069009=Check the geometry type.
messagedetail2069010=The number of arguments for the geometry is not enough : {0} is required but got only {1}.
cause2069010=The number of arguments does not match.
action2069010=Check the geometry arguments.
messagedetail2069011=The number of coordinate does not match with the given dimension( {0} ).
cause2069011=The number of coordinates does not match.
action2069011=Check the geometry coordinates.
messagedetail2069012=The geometry type is different from the expected type, {1} : {0} ).
cause2069012=The geometry type is different from the expected geometry type: {1}
action2069012=Make sure the geometry type is {1}
messagedetail2069013=The srid of geometry is different from the expected srid, {1} : {0} ).
cause2069013=The srid is different from the expected srid: {1}
action2069013=Make sure the srid of geometry is {1}
messagedetail2069014=The dimension of geometry is different from the expected dimension, {1} : {0}.
cause2069014=The dimension of geometry is different from the expected dimension: {1}
action2069014=Make sure the dimension of geometry is {1}
messagedetail2069015=The arrayKey({0}) does not exist or the type is not array.
cause2069015=Invalid arrayKey({0}) is used
action2069015=Make sure the arrayKey({0}) exists and the type is array.
messagedetail2069016=The srid {0} is not supported for a circle.
cause2069016=Invalid srid {0} is used for a circle.
action2069016=Make sure the srid is either 0 or 8307.
messagedetail2069017=Tolerance reflects the distance that two points can be apart and still be considered the same.The tolerance value must be a positive number greater than zero.
cause2069017=NonPositive tolerance used on geometries.
action2069017=Make sure you specify a Positive tolerance.
