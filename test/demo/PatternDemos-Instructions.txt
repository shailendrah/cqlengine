***Do not save the excel any time.. ***
Reason: If you save the excel, some of the calculated data might be saved and the chart may not be shown correctly.
        If by mistake you saved it.. get the previous original version and try it again.

***Do not start the excel file before you start the query and make sure the scheduler started running.(after you see the "alter system run" command on screen) ***
Reason: Tables won't refresh if they find no output files exist.
        If by mistake you have dont it, close the excel and re do.
